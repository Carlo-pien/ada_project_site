                            Alright, our datasets are complete, clean and ready to be used. Now, let’s try to get a feeling for how the pandemic propagated in the physical world and how it propagated in our virtual wikipedia world!

                            For the first part, we are going to look at the covid-related deaths, as they provide a metric that is independent of the testing intensity of countries. For the second, we are of course looking at the pageview statistics for the covid-related articles. How do the propagations maps look like ? Let’s see! 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            We plot the relationship between the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and Wikipedia page views related to the disease by comparing the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per country to the cumulative number of Wikipedia page views. Both numbers are normalized per 100,000 inhabitants for each country. The period we plot (22 of January 2020 to 4th of August 2020) roughly corresponds to the first wave.

                            There are multiple interesting observations that can be made from the evolving maps. The most significant event being the introduction of lockdowns in Europe around the 18th of March 2020. This date marks the moment when the Wikipedia pageviews start to drastically increase.[BY WHAT?]
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            The pageviews of COVID-related articles vary among different countries. Germany and the Czech Republic have high pageviews at 38k and 34k per 100k inhabitants respectively, but low numbers of deaths at 11 and 4 per 100k, while Sweden has low pageviews but high numbers of deaths: 5.8k pageviews for 59 deaths per 100k inhabitants!
                         </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            This may be due to the fact that the Swedish Wikipedia has few Covid-related articles (17), so Sweden's inhabitants may be documenting themselves using the English Wikipedia. However, considering the number of articles in Czech (48), it is difficult to explain the four-order-of-magnitude difference between the pageviews per 100k inhabitants of Sweden and Czechia solely by the difference in the number of articles.  Maybe the Swedes didn't care as much about COVID?

                            Before going into a deeper case study, let's take a look again at the whole pandemic from January 2020 to July 2022 to understand general dynamics of information seeking behaviour around the world.
                            For that, let's visualize the monthly evolution of pageviews, COVID cases and deaths.

                                        COVID cases and deaths are strongly related, with an increase in cases leading to an increase in deaths with a small delay,
                                    </p> 
                                </li>

                                        Different waves of the pandemic occurred at different times in different countries. European countries had their first wave in March 2020 and then another important wave in November 2020. For West Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Israel the first wave appears later in July 2020 and for Botswana only in March 2021,

                                    </p>

                                        There is a strong relation between the evolution of the pandemic and number of pageviews related to it during the first wave, but this relation does not remain constant throughout the pandemic. One can illustrate that with Italy that arrived at the same time in the top 3 countries in the different bar races and dropped down after everywhere, 
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                                        Some countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, remained consistently high in terms of pageviews per million inhabitants despite relatively low numbers of cases and deaths,
                                    </p> 
                                </li>

                                        Overall, one can observe that the pageviews are more consitent over the whole period.

                                        China was never among the top 15 countries in terms of pageviews, cases and deaths, possibly due to government censorship of information related to COVID-19.

                        Now that we have a sense of the evolution of the pandemic and the digital propagation the last two years, we go deeper in the analysis by studying the evolution of the regression by windows of 60 day that relates these two dataset by country. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            For that, we fit a linear regression on the cumulative wikipedia pageviews and the cumulative deaths per country adding an intercept, and we plot the evolution of the fitted line through the time.

                            Looking at this Figure, one notice that the slope of the line decreases with the time. It passes from  81.01% (p-value: 0.03) to 5.52% (p-value: 0.67). These values show that the earlier in the pandemic we were, the higher was the relation between COVID-19 deaths and wikipedia page views. However, with the arrival of the new waves, it decreases and the p-value of 0.67 shows even that we can not reject a no slope in the middle of 2021. This is due to the fact that people were already well informed on the disease. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            Another point shown on the animated plot is the evolution of the position of each country related to the regression line. Some stay above it all the time such as Germany, others stay below Bangladesh and most of them varied their position. This highlights the interest or even the fear of the population towards COVID-19. In fact, the first group will search more information on the COVID-19 than the mean for a fixed number of deaths. On the other hand, the second group has less interest in this disease. Finally, the last group changes depending on the different waves in their countries.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            Finally, we notice an increase of the slope of the regression line at the end of 2021 which coincides with the arrival of the Omicron variant and the third dose of vaccine in Europe.
